Hello dear reader,

This is an application I developed for my 4th year project for Carleton University. 


## What Does This App Do? ##

It was a web-based peer-to-peer multi-person conferencing application built using WebRTC. It was supposed to have the ability to conduct a multi-person conference (like Skype), while also have the ability to have multiple viewers watching the conversation at real-time (like on Twitch).


## Rules Of The Game ##

1. Open the application through your browser
2. Choose whether to join a conference as a "caster" or a "viewer"
3. Enter the credentials
4. Enjoy


## FAQs ##

__What features does it have?__

It has basic features like multi-person video/audo chat, text chat, and file-transfer.

__Is it done?__

No. As long as WebRTC keeps changing, I get more experienced, features are needed, or bugs need to be solved, this is never over. This is a project I will be working on during my spare time.

__How does this application scale?__

Right now, not so well. It was one of the hardest things to tackle during my project -- How do you make a peer-to-peer application without ending up with a dredded n^2 network. At the moment, it is nearly an n^2 network and I am still trying to improve it.

__I am new to WebRTC and I am curious about how it works. Can we chat?__

Sure thing. I promise not to bite.
